Hi, I'm Liam!

This site is my personal blog and storage spot for little projects and files.
I'm hoping for it to serve as a sort of folio to showcase my writing, design,
and webdev skills.

As according to my own principles, I have decided that all projects I author
will be in the public domain. As such all projects will include a CC0 waiver.

To serve as an example, below is the waiver for the site itself:

{{< waiver "ljpatrick.link" "https://ljpatrick.link/about" >}}
